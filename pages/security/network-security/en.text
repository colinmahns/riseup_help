h2. Improve your network security

The internet is a wild place. Practically ever click you make is now recorded, archived, and analyzed by a computer somewhere in order to predict your consumer behavior or enforce the laws of the nation state. The moment you put a computer on the internet, it is likely to be probed for vulnerabilities by viruses and crackers hoping to conscript it into a "zombie bot army":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_computer.

Yikes! What is an internet user to do? These pages will help you configure your computer to prevent these attacks [_at the network level_].
