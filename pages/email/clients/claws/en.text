h2. What is Claws?

!>img/it_bites.png!

Claws Mail is the mail client bundled with "Tails - The Amnesiac Incognito Live System":https://tails.boum.org/ which makes it an obvious mail client choice if you are using that platform. It is Free Software and is available for a variety of Unix-type platforms, and Windows. You can download Claws Mail "from the Claws Mail website":http://www.claws-mail.org/downloads.php?section=downloads. 

Claws Mail aims to be feature rich, fast, and stable.  It has IMAP and POP support, multiple account support, colored labels, spell checking, filtering, and support for OpenPGP encryption.

h2. Setup Claws Mail

h3.  The First Time - Setup Wizard

The first time you run Claws Mail, the setup wizard will walk you through setting up an account. If the wizard does not open, see section "Manual Account Creation" below.

*If using Tails* you will almost certainly want to "configure a persistent volume":https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/configure/index.en.html and enable "GnuPG", and "Claws Mail".

# Enter your name/alias and e-mail address on the first page 
# Click "Forward" to advance to the next screen
# Choose server type as POP3 or IMAP (IMAP leaves mail on server, POP3 downloads it locally - this means IMAP is a good choice if you have multiple machines accessing the mailbox and POP3 is a slightly better choice for privacy and the POP3 user experience is much faster)
# Enter *mail.riseup.net* for the "Server address" (both for IMAP and POP3)
# Enter your username (without @riseup.net) and password
# Select "Use SSL to connect to receiving server" and also select "Use SSL via STARTTLS"
# Click "Forward" to advance to the next screen
# Enter *mail.riseup.net* for the "SMTP server address"
# Select "Use authentication" (you can leave the SMTP username and password fields blank)
# Select "Use SSL to connect to receiving server" and also select "Use SSL via STARTTLS"
# Click "Forward" to advance to the next screen
# *If using POP3 on Tails*: For "Mailbox name" enter */home/amnesia/.claws-mail/Mail* (this step is very important for Tails users because the default Mail folder location is not-persisted between reboots) and click "Forward" to advance to the next screen
# Click "Save" to complete the process

h3.  Manual Account Creation

While running Claws Mail select "Configuration > Create New Account" from the menubar.

# *Basic Settings* - enter a name for your account, enter your name, mail address, select POP3 or IMAP, enter *mail.riseup.net* for both the "Server for receiving" and "SMTP server (send)" fields, and your riseup.net userid (without @riseup.net) and password

# *Send Settings* - select "SMTP Authentication"

# *SSL Settings* - Select STARTTLS for both POP3 and SMTP.

# *Advanced settings* - Change the SMTP port to 587 (POP3 can stay as 110)

# Click "OK" to finish adding your new account

h3.  First Time, SSL Certificates

When checking your mail for the first time, and also sending your first message, you will see an SSL confirmation dialog like this:

!img/ssl.png!

When you see this be sure to "View certificate" details dropdown and verify the SSL certificate SHA1 certificate against the [[published fingerprints for riseup.net => /security/network-security/certificates]].

Claws Mail will store these certificates and let you know if they ever change which may indicate an attempted man-in-the-attack, or just that riseup.net updated their certificates.  Any time you get this SSL pop-up, verify the fingerprints!

h3. Warnings

* If you are using the Claws Mail under Tails it is important to verify that your local mail folders are setup in a persistent location before permanently removing any mail from the server or you may lose mail!

h3. You're Done!

If you are using IMAP everything should just work automatically.  If you are using POP3 click the "Get Mail" icon in the toolbar to refresh your mail.

h2. What is next?

h3. Enhance your email security

# There are many vulnerabilities with how secure connections work. If you need high security, you should always connect to Riseup services using the [[Riseup VPN => vpn]]. This will prevent a long list of potential attacks against your communication.
