h2. Can I set up an automatic out-of-office reply?

No, Riseup does not support out-of-office replies. The most important reason why is because if you have auto-response enabled, you respond to spam email. Spammers thus have your email address as somebody who responds to spam, which makes your email more valuable to spammers, and thus you get spammed more.

Also, they can be annoying. For example, if you are on any mailing list they can go out to the whole list. Riseup already has problems where we get blocked as spam by major providers, and having auto-replies coming from riseup accounts could only increase that problem.
